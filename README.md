## What is this?

This is my final university assessment piece for DECO1400 â€“ Introduction to Web Design.
The brief was to build a static website that provided education content, utilising a fictional story as the theme. The website is an interactive learning experience where ages 10-15 get to learn about computer components. Students are guided through this experience by Dr Frankenstein and encouraged to pass a quiz in order to help the Dr bring his creations to life. We had to create various stages of the design process, including user testing, paper prototyping and stakeholder engagement. 

## Tools

We were required to use HTML, CSS and jQuery to build the website.
I used GIMP and Inkscape to design Dr Frankenstein using images of myself in a lab coat.
(Computer component icons were sources from the Public Domain).

## Current Limitations

As the users would be in a classroom environment the website was design for use on iPad size screens or larger.
Also compatibility was limited to chrome and firefox.
