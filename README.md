## 📖 About The Project

This web application is designed to be an engaging educational tool for children & young adults, to learn about the fundamental hardware components of a personal computer. 

Through a "lab" theme, students are guided to explore different parts of a computer, understand their functions through simple analogies (like comparing the CPU to a brain or the RAM to short-term memory), and then test their knowledge in a quiz.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of the session, students should be able to identify and describe the function of:

*   **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**: The "brain" that makes decisions.
*   **RAM (Random Access Memory)**: The "short-term memory" for active tasks.
*   **Motherboard**: The "skeleton & nerves" that connects all parts together.
*   **PSU (Power Supply Unit)**: The "digestion" or energy source.
*   **HDD/SSD (Storage)**: The "long-term memory" for saving files.
*   **GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)**: The "eyes" that handle visuals.

## 🚀 Features

*   **Interactive Learning Dashboard**: Clickable components that display easy-to-understand information.
*   **Analogy-Based Explanations**: Uses real-world concepts (brains, skeletons, food) to explain technical terms.
*   **Knowledge Quiz**: A 5-question multiple-choice quiz to validate learning.
*   **Instant Feedback**: Immediate results on quiz submission (Win/Loss screens).
*   **Responsive Design**: Works well on tablets (iPad size) and larger desktop screens.
*   **Lightweight**: Pure static site with no heavy frameworks.

## 🛠️ Built With

*   **HTML5**: For semantic page structure.
*   **CSS3**: For styling, layout (Flexbox), and animations.
*   **Vanilla JavaScript**: For user interaction, DOM manipulation, and logic (replacing previous jQuery dependencies).
