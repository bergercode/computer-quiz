# computer-quiz

A website that teaches kids the basic components of a computer.

## What is this?

This is my final university assessment piece for DECO1400 â€“ Introduction to Web Design. 

The brief was to build a static website that provided some kind of education content, utalising a fictional story as the theme.
The website is a interactive learning experience where the 10-15 year old demographic gets to learn about computer components.
