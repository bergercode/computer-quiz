# computer-quiz

A website that teaches kids the basic components of a computer.

## What is this?

This is my final university assessment piece for DECO1400 â€“ Introduction to Web Design.
The brief was to build a static website that provided education content, utilising a fictional story as the theme. The website is an interactive learning experience where ages 10-15 get to learn about computer components.
