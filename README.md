# computer-quiz

A website that teaches kids the basic components of a computer.

## What is this?

This is my final university assessment piece for DECO1400 â€“ Introduction to Web Design.
The brief was to build a static website that provided education content, utilising a fictional story as the theme. The website is an interactive learning experience where ages 10-15 get to learn about computer components. Students are guided through this experience by Dr Frankenstein and encouraged to pass a quiz in order to help Dr Frankenstein bring his creations to life.

## Tools

We were required to use HTML, CSS and jQuery to build the website.
I used GIMP and Inkscape to design Dr Frankenstein using images of myself in a lab coat.
